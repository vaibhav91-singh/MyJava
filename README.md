# Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practice

This repository contains my personal progress and code implementations for core **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts in Java. This project follows a structured approach to mastering the four pillars of OOP and other essential Java features.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized by concept, with specific files targeting different Java functionalities:

* **`Constructor/`**: Contains logic for object initialization, using `this` keywords, and parameterized constructors.
* **`Abstraction.java`**: Implementation of abstract classes and methods to hide implementation details.
* **`Inheritance.java`**: Demonstrating parent-child class relationships and code reusability.
* **`OverRiding.java`**: Focuses on Method Overriding (Polymorphism) and how subclasses redefine parent methods.
* **`Superinfo.java`**: Use cases for the `super` keyword to access parent class constructors and methods.
* **`ToStringg.java`**: Practice on overriding the `toString()` method for custom object representation.
* **`Car.java` & `Student.java`**: Model classes used to demonstrate real-world object blueprints.

## 🛠 Concepts Covered

### 1. The Four Pillars of OOP


* **Abstraction:** Using `abstract` classes to define templates for other classes.
* **Inheritance:** Passing properties and methods from one class to another.
* **Polymorphism:** specifically Method Overriding, allowing a single action to be performed in different ways.
* **Encapsulation:** (In Progress) Protecting data using private variables and getters/setters.

### 2. Java Specifics
* **Constructors:** Learning how to instantiate objects with specific states.
* **Method Overriding:** Using `@Override` to change inherited behavior.
* **The Object Class:** Understanding how every class in Java inherits from the root `Object` class.
